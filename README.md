# Vulnerability Scan and Remediation Lab

## Objective

The purpose of this lab is to demonstrate the process of vulnerability scanning and remediation. In this project, I set up Nessus Essentials to perform credentialed scans of a local Metasploitable VM hosted on VMWare. I'll be demonstrating the hands-on process of identifying vulnerabilities and implementing remediation solutions with detailed vulnerability report, including risk assessments and remediation recommendations as well as explaining the vulnerabilities and their potential impact.

### Skills Learned
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used
- Nessus
#
  Here I have downloaded and installed Nessus so I can run my scans.

#
And here is the Windows 10 VM. Where I will be running the scans.

#
Before I started to run any scans I needed to ensure that I could ping the Windows 10 VM so I ran ipconfig and got the IP for this machine.
![ipconfig](https://github.com/Myles0813/Vulnerability-Scan-and-Remediation/assets/149546194/c34ff4a0-45ea-4259-9fd5-22f552dabf96)
#
To ensure that I could connect to the Windows 10 Machine I ran a ping from my host OS and got a request timeout.

I needed to disable Windows Defender Firewall so I went over to Windows Security and turned off all firewall states.

I ran the ping again and got responses back!

The next step was to run a basic network scan with no configurations. So I did that and the results...

#
Now I want to make some configurations to the Windows 10 Machine and see what results appear with the next scan.

#
After that, I headed back to Nessus to run a credentialed scan.
![cred](https://github.com/Myles0813/Vulnerability-Scan-and-Remediation/assets/149546194/bf6bf766-c4d7-47f4-b5e6-bb7410696faf)
#
And you can now see high-impact vulnerabilities on Nessus after making those configurations.

# 
After the 2nd scan, I downloaded a deprecated version of Mozilla Firefox to see how many vulnerabilities it would expose to the Windows 10 machine.
![fox](https://github.com/Myles0813/Vulnerability-Scan-and-Remediation/assets/149546194/2140de70-1868-448a-a4cd-ba761e6bccaa)
#
After installing Firefox I ran a 3rd scan and there were many vulnerabilities exposed on the machine.
![firescan](https://github.com/Myles0813/Vulnerability-Scan-and-Remediation/assets/149546194/718d8619-9638-4a4f-81a2-d5d6a4223232)
#
Firefox alone opened up 177 critical vulnerabilities to this machine. 
![177](https://github.com/Myles0813/Vulnerability-Scan-and-Remediation/assets/149546194/28202247-86da-4187-920b-9f6bfa99a64a)
#
Now the next step I took was to remediate some of these vulnerabilities from the system. We can see that underneath the Remediations tab, it says to Upgrade to resolve for most of the issues. Also, Uninstalling any applications or programs would suffice.

#
I just decided to uninstall Firefox from this machine.
![uninstall](https://github.com/Myles0813/Vulnerability-Scan-and-Remediation/assets/149546194/0e6303f9-cb20-4f6a-9210-a67da9a09bc8)

#
Next, I ran some Windows updates.

#
I ran one last scan and I can see that all the vulnerabilities from Firefox have been removed!

#
And the last step was to run some Windows Security updates. And all vulnerabilities have been removed!

### Conclusion
The purpose of this was to demonstrate the impact that applications can have on a system and the vulnerabilities they can expose.
